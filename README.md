# Funny-Eye-Tracker
A small project where the eyes of the random faces are tracking your cursor 

How It Works:
1.	A random face is downloaded from the internet.
2.	Mediapipe detects facial landmarks, especially eye regions.
3.	Pygame displays the image in a window.
4.	Two white circles represent eyeballs; a smaller black dot (pupil) moves inside each eye to follow the mouse.
5.	This creates a funny and interactive eye-tracking effect.
